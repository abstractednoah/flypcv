# flypcv
simple, clean, and dynamic LaTeX documentclass for resume aka cv.

documentation is pending -- for now, see in-line comments, which should be fairly user-friendly.  
feel free to have a look at [my cv repository](https://github.com/analyticalnoa/analyticalnoa-cv) for a sample use of this class.
